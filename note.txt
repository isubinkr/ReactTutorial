NPM doesn't stand for Node Package Manager.
It is a Package Mangaer but it doesn't stand for Node Package Manager.
Sometimes packages are also called dependencies

terminal command to configure NPM: 

    npm init -y // but this skips a lot of thing 

    npm init

    This will ask a few things like package name, version, entry point, test command,...
    in test command coloumn write jest

This will create a new file package.json with every details entered by us written in it.
This package.json file is configuration for our npm.

Now we have configured npm into our project now we can get packages/dependencies into our project.

The most imp package in our project is a bundler -> It bundles our app it packages our app properly so that it can be shipped together

We are going to use parcel for our app

    npm install -D parcel  //There are 2 types of dependencies (dev dependencies & normal dependencies) //tilde(~) vs caret(^)
