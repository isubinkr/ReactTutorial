create a folder

make sure the directory is set to that folder in terminal 

#1 - To configure npm into our project
     % npm init
(or) % npm init -y   // This skips a lot of steps

    This will ask a few things like package name, version, entry point, test command,...
    in test command coloumn write jest

#2 - installing bundler (parcel)
     % npm install -D parcel

     // -D beacuse we install bunder as devDependencies
     // We don't use -D in case or react/.... because we install them as normal dependencies

#3 - installing react & react-dom
     % npm install react
     % npm install react-dom    // we can use "i" only in place of "install"

     <script type="module" src="./src/App.js"></script>  // Make sure to include module type

#4 - creating shortcut for npx run index.html
    "scripts": {
        "start": "parcel index.html",
        "build": "parcel build index.html",
        "test": "jest"
    },
     // Add this into package.json (otherwise we will always have to write "npx parcel index.html" everytime to run our build "npx parcel buuild index.html" for production app)
     // Now we can use npm run start/ npm start for dev build
     // and "npm run build" for production app (npm build -> won't work)

#5 - installing react-router-dom
      % npm i react-router-dom
      // to use routing

#6 - installing tailwindcss 
      follow tailwindcss website

#7 - installling @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
      npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
      npm i react-redux
